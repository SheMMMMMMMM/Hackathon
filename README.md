# SeniorSync: AI-Powered Life Companion for Older Adults

SeniorSync is an AI-powered life companion designed to keep older adults safer, more connected, and more independent by combining empathetic conversation, health monitoring, scam protection, and family coordination in a simple, senior-friendly experience. It targets a rapidly aging European population facing rising loneliness, fraud, and caregiver shortages with technology that feels like talking to a trusted human, not using a complicated app.

## The Problem by 2030

By 2030, around one in four Europeans will be aged 65 or older, dramatically increasing demand for care and support while health and social systems are already under strain. Many older adults live alone or far from family, amplifying risks around loneliness, health decline, and financial exploitation.

- **Loneliness and isolation** are linked to worse mental and physical health, including depression, cognitive decline, and dementia.
- **Elder fraud and scams** cost older adults billions annually, with digital channels increasing attack frequency and sophistication.
- **Caregiver shortages** prevent 24/7 human support, especially in rural or underserved areas.
- **Mainstream technology** often frustrates seniors with small text, complex flows, and jargon-heavy interfaces.

SeniorSync addresses these converging issues with an autonomous, always-available AI companion designed for older adults and their families.
